# User Overview Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of user data, focusing on various metrics such as data usage, session count, and application usage. The core functionality is encapsulated in the `UserOverviewAnalysis` class, which processes user data, performs statistical analysis, and visualizes insights.

## Project Overview

The `UserOverviewAnalysis` class includes several methods to analyze and visualize user data. It processes data to generate aggregates, analyze top users, app usage, and perform advanced analyses like PCA. The class also provides functionalities for segmenting users, plotting histograms, and performing correlation analysis.

## Installation

### Creating a Virtual Environment

#### Using Conda

If you prefer Conda as your package manager:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project directory.
3. Run the following command to create a new Conda environment:

    ```bash
    conda create --name your_env_name python=3.12.5
    ```
    - Replace `your_env_name` with the desired name for your environment (e.g., `user_analysis`) and `3.12.5` with your preferred Python version.

4. Activate the environment:

    ```bash
    conda activate your_env_name
    ```

#### Using Virtualenv

If you prefer using `venv`, Python's built-in virtual environment module:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project directory.
3. Run the following command to create a new virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv your_env_name
    ```
    - Replace `your_env_name` with the desired name for your environment.

4. Activate the environment:

    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\your_env_name\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source your_env_name/bin/activate
        ```

### Installing Dependencies

Once your virtual environment is created and activated, you can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
